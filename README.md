# GalaxyLifeReborn

**GalaxyLifeReborn** is a project that aims to revive the Android version of Galaxy Life (Galaxy Life: Pocket Adventures) from scratch. This is basically an attempt to reproduce the game server by reverse engineering the game client.

### Server setup

The server requires some dependencies that can be installed with the following command:
> python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

### Starting the server

To start the server you'll simply need to use the following command:
> cd src && python app.py

### More information

I tried to detail the approach I followed while reverse engineering [here](https://github.com/Galaxy1036/GalaxyLifeReborn/wiki), feel free to give it a look if you're interested.
